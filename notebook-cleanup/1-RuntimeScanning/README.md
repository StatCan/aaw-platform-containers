## STILL TODO
Get this thing in DEV (its fine to output to terminal initially)
X) Have a little clean-up script for kubectl that will delete the previous runs so its not stuck in terminated / Completed.

1) Pass in credentials for the pull to work
2) Pass in credentials for the xray-get vulnerabilities to work
3) Edit xray-query.json to match whatever watch-name I use
4) Actually test
